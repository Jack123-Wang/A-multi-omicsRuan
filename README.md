Scripts used for data analysis in "A multi-omics integrative analysis based on CRISPR screens re-defines the pluripotency regulatory network in ESCs"

We thank Dr.Jianming Zeng(University of Macau), and all the members of his bioinformatics team, biotrainee, for generously sharing their experience and codes.

Most scripts rely on the use of basic read aligment and processing tools:
